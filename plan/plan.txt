📌 Kazi Mtaani Management System – Development Blueprint
🎯 Goal
To build a digital management platform for the Kazi Mtaani program that streamlines attendance tracking, payments, and reporting, while ensuring accountability and transparency using Face Recognition AI.

🚀 Core Features
1. Worker & Supervisor Accounts
Authentication & role-based access using Clerk.


Workers → View attendance, payment history, group details.


Supervisors → Manage groups, approve attendance, oversee reports.



2. Attendance System
Workers check in by scanning a QR code at the worksite.


System prompts for a quick selfie to verify identity.




If match passes → attendance is logged.


If mismatch → supervisor is alerted.


Logs include worker ID, group, timestamp, location (GPS).


Tech stack:
QR Code → simple web/mobile scanner.


Face Recognition → AWS Rekognition / Azure Face API / FaceNet.


Storage → PostgreSQL (attendance logs, facial embeddings).



3. Payments & M-Pesa Integration
Supervisors approve attendance → triggers payment batch.


M-Pesa API used for automated disbursements.


Payment tracking:


Worker dashboard shows payment status, history, deductions.


Admin dashboard can reconcile funds vs disbursed wages.



4. Supervisor Reports (Smart Reporting)
Weekly attendance + payment data compiled into PDF/Excel.


Reports include:


Attendance rates by group/worker.


Payment summaries.


Alerts for irregularities (e.g., repeated absences).


Exportable for submission to higher authorities.

🔐 Security & Integrity
Workers can’t clock in for others → AI face recognition prevents “buddy punching”.


Payments tied directly to attendance logs.


Supervisors have audit trails (who approved what, when).
